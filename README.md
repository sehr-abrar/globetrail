# 🌍 GlobeTrail

> Your personalized travel companion for maximizing short trips and layovers.

## 📌 Overview

GlobeTrail (GT) is an app designed to create personalized travel itineraries based on the user's available time and interests. It offers time-based recommendations and includes an interactive map with suggested places. We chose this solution because time is fleeting, especially for occasional travelers who want to make the most of their journeys, whether in unfamiliar or familiar places.

GlobeTrail addresses this by creating personalized itineraries tailored to the user's available time and interests, ensuring they can explore meaningful places efficiently. The app provides interactive maps with suggested locations, and time-based recommendations. It also includes features like travel alerts, multilingual support, and the ability to save and share itineraries. By integrating these elements, GlobeTrail helps travelers maximize their limited time, offering a seamless and enriching experience that enhances their connection to the places they visit, making every moment of their journey count.
